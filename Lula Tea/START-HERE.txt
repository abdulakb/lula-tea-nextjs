# 🚀 QUICK START - 3 Simple Steps!

## Your project folder should now be open in File Explorer!

---

## Step 1: Close ALL PowerShell Windows ❌
- Close every PowerShell/Command Prompt window you have open
- This is IMPORTANT because they don't see the Node.js you just installed

---

## Step 2: Double-Click START-WEBSITE.bat 🖱️
- In the File Explorer window that just opened
- Find the file: **START-WEBSITE.bat**
- **Double-click it!**

It will:
- Check if Node.js is installed ✓
- Install dependencies automatically ✓
- Start the website server ✓

---

## Step 3: Open Your Browser 🌐
- Wait for the message: "Lula Tea Server running on http://localhost:3000"
- Open your browser
- Go to: **http://localhost:3000**
- Your website is LIVE! 🎉

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Live Server vs Node.js Server

**Live Server (VS Code extension):**
- ❌ Does NOT work for this project
- Only for static HTML files
- Cannot run Node.js/Express applications

**Node.js Server (what we're using):**
- ✅ Runs your complete e-commerce website
- Handles user login, shopping cart, payments
- Uses Express, EJS templates, and database

### If the batch file shows an error:

**"Node.js is not found in PATH"**
- Solution: **Restart your computer**
- This ensures Node.js is properly registered
- Then try again

**Port 3000 is already in use**
- Solution: Edit `.env` file
- Change `PORT=3000` to `PORT=3001`
- Try again

---

## 🎯 That's It!

Just 3 steps:
1. Close PowerShell windows
2. Double-click `START-WEBSITE.bat`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

**The File Explorer window with your project should be open now!** 📁

Look for **START-WEBSITE.bat** and double-click it! ✨

## 🔄 To Stop the Server

When the server is running:
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the window
- Or just close the window

To start it again, double-click `START-WEBSITE.bat`!
